        <h1 id='events'>Managing Your Group</h1>

        <p>In what follows, we discuss how to plan and run your Study Group, and describe some possible event types. A few key points to begin with:</p>

        <div class='well' style='background-color:#FFF2CC'>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Let the community lead.</strong> At every opportunity, ask the attendees what they'd like to see at a future event - and invite them to lead. The more people have a hand in designing and throwing events, the more diverse, useful and community-driven your Study Group will be.</li>
            <li><strong>Plan a few months at a time.</strong> Choose a natural rhythm for your group - semesters, terms, or quarters - and try to sketch out a rough plan at the beginning of the period by asking for input from your community, and spreading ideas out.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate clearly.</strong> This means making sure all event listing and emails include time, place (with link to a map) and a short description of what the event is about, and reminding people a couple of times to come on out.</li>
            <li><strong>Use your Code of Conduct.</strong> Your Code is there to make sure people feel welcome and are included; don't be afraid to emphasize it and enforce it when the need arises.</li>
            <li><strong>Stick to it!</strong> It might take an event or two for people to tell their friends and word to spread; don't be discouraged if only a few people come to your first couple of events. Stick to it, and you'll have a thriving community soon enough.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h1 id='planning'>Planning Events</h1>

        <p>Now that you have a team assembled and a few mailing lists in your community to help spread the word, it's time to start planning and throwing events! Here are a few ideas to keep things running as smoothly as possible.</p>

        <h2>Pace Yourself</h2>

        <p>Many Study Groups enjoy a ton of excitement and energy when they first get going - events happen every week, attendance is high, and lots of people step up to lead sessions. But, after burning hot and bright for a few months, it can get hard to find a steady stream of content to keep momentum going. Follow these steps to keep a steady pace that's easy to maintain and manage.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Choose a natural rhythm</strong> for your community - terms, semesters, or quarters.</li>
          <li><strong>Do a big advertising push</strong> at the beginning of each of these periods, letting people know about Study Group, and asking them what sessions they'd like to see or lead.</li>
          <li>Take the most popular suggestions from your advertising push, and <strong>spread them out evenly</strong> over the term, one every two weeks.</li>
          <li>In the free weeks, book events like <a href="event-types.html#coworking">coworking sessions</a>, or other ideas that come up through the term.</li>
          <li>Throw in a <a href="event-types.html#hackyhour">hacky hour</a> once a month.</li>
          <li><strong>End the period with a big get together</strong> for the whole community, to thank them for participating and ask them what they'd like to do next term. Also take this opportunity to discuss with the organizing team what worked this term, and what needs improvement.</li>
        </ul>



        <!--p>Many Study Groups enjoy a ton of excitement and energy when they first get going - events happen every week, attendance is high, and lots of people step up to lead sessions. But, after burning hot and bright for a few months, it can get hard to find a steady stream of content to keep momentum going.</p>

        <p>In order to avoid this, it's important to <strong>plan around the right cadence</strong> for your group; for most institutions, this will be terms, semesters, or quarters - whatever the natural division of time is in your community that splits the year up into three or four parts. At the beginning of terms, people's schedules change - some people will become unavailable, and others will find themselves newly able to attend, which makes this the perfect time to do a big push to advertise your group as widely and loudly as possible.</p>

        <p>As you advertise at the beginning of each term, ask people to suggest topics for lessons; ask them what they're working on, what they'd be interested in leading a session on, and what they'd like to learn about.</p>

        <p>Once responses come in, take the most popular ones and spread them out throughout the term, ideally one every two weeks; that way, both you and your community will have a clear calendar of what to look forward to for the next few months, and you'll save yourself the stress of constantly worrying about what to do next week.</p>

        <p>On the off weeks, add in events like <a href="event-types.html#coworking">coworking sessions</a>, or throw in new lessons or event ideas as they come up, and once a month do a <a href="event-types.html#hackyhour">hacky hour</a> to help new people come meet the community.</p> 

        <p> Finally, at the end of the term, take the opportunity to get everyone together to thank them for participating, and ask them what they'd like to see in future. Also, get together in private with the organizing team to discuss how the term went; what events were the most popular? What didn't go as planned? How diverse across gender, culture and scientific discipline were your attendees? How can you reach an even wider audience next term? At this point, huge congratulations are in order - you delivered a whole term of learning, building and community bonding! Jot down some lessons learned, and next term will be even better. </p-->

        <h2>Communicating Events</h2>

        <p>Nobody will come to your events if you don't let people know about them! Follow these steps to effectively communicate about each individual event.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>As early as possible</strong> and at least one week in advance, <a href="https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup#how-to-launch-a-new-event">list your event on your website</a>. Detailed instructions are in the README.md in your repo - basically, make an issue that includes the time, date, place (with a map), topic, and preparation instructions, and add a listing on your website.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus on the issue tracker.</strong> There can be a lot of links and information for an event - location, lesson notes, examples to download - stay organized by putting all the relevant information in the first post for the issue in the issue tracker, and direct all attention to this issue in subsequent communications.</li>
          <li><strong>At the start of the week</strong>, send a reminder email to all the mailing lists you have access to, pointing out the events happening that week (remember to include links to the issues describing the events, as well as a link to your Code of Conduct, and tell people to bring their friends!).</li>
          <li><strong>The morning of the event</strong>, comment on the issue describing the event - even a simple 'Looking forward to this today!' is enough, since that will send a notification to everyone watching your repo.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Also, don't forget to ask people to watch your github repo - that way, they'll get updates about everything your Study Group is doing.</p>

        <h1 id='reporting'>Reporting Back</h1>

        <p>By starting a Study Group, you are joining a worldwide community of like-minded folks, trying to bring their local communities together. The next step, is to help plug your Study Group into the rest of this worldwide network by taking a few simple steps:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ask your demo leaders to post their notes</strong> in their own GitHub repo. Then, <a href="mailto:sciencelab@mozillafoundation.org">send us an email</a> so we can add that lesson to our <a href="https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroupLessons">collection</a> of lessons from around the world. Of course, this collection flows both ways - feel free to grab lessons from here to deliver at your own group! Also, add a link to the notes repo to the issue created for the corresponding event, and add a <a href="https://github.com/minisciencegirl/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/dplyr/lesson.md">stub</a> in your '/lessons' directory in your main Study Group repo.</li>
          <li><strong>Get in touch</strong> with the Science Lab by <a href="mailto:bill@mozillafoundation.org">emailing us</a>, and letting us know what you're up to - we'd love to schedule a monthly catch-up video call with you, to find out what you're up to and answer any questions you may have. </li>
          <li><strong>Join in the Study Group Leader's Call</strong>: once a month, we'll be hosting a google hangout for Study Group organizers to share what they've been up to and trade ideas for events and strategies; get in touch with the Science Lab above, and we'll send you the details to join in.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>You're good to go!</h2>
        <p>After working through the setup and planning in the last two chapters, you are all set to start running a Mozilla Study Group! Remember, this group is for your community - always feel free to remix, reimagine and reinvent anything you like in order to make Study Group what your community wants it to be. The only rule is to always try to include as many different people as possible. Remember to <a href="mailto:sciencelab@mozillafoundation.org">email us</a> as you get started, and never hesitate to make suggestions or ask for help; we look forward to hearing from you!</p>

        <p>In the appendices of this Handbook, you'll find a <a href="event-types.html">list of event ideas</a>, and a collection of links to <a href="lessons.html">lessons</a> you can reuse in your own Study Group; as always, please feel free to suggest additions and new ideas!</p>
